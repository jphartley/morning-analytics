# **Programmatic Retrieval of Midjourney Assets: Technical Implementation and Compliance Report (2026)**

## **Executive Summary**

The integration of Midjourney’s generative AI capabilities into third-party applications remains one of the most complex challenges in the current generative media landscape. As of early 2026, Midjourney adheres to a strict "no public API" policy, channeling all interaction through Discord and its proprietary web interface. This report provides an exhaustive technical analysis of the feasible methods for programmatically retrieving image outputs and metadata from Midjourney, operating within the constraints of Discord’s platform architecture and evolving security policies.  
**Core Findings:**

* **Absence of Official Interface:** Midjourney offers no REST API, SDK, or webhook infrastructure for developers.1 Retrieval must be architected around the interception of data flows within the Discord ecosystem.  
* **The "Passive Listener" Imperative:** The only compliant and stable method for retrieval is the deployment of a Discord Bot configured as a "passive listener." This architecture captures MESSAGE\_CREATE events generated by the Midjourney Bot in a controlled server environment, extracting data without violating policies against "user automation" (self-bots).3  
* **Critical Infrastructure Shift (CDN):** Discord’s transition to Signed Attachment URLs has rendered static hotlinking obsolete. All retrieval systems must now implement an immediate "download-and-store" pipeline. URLs extracted from Discord message payloads are valid only temporarily (typically 24 hours), necessitating their immediate transfer to independent object storage (e.g., AWS S3).5  
* **Privileged Intent Barriers:** Accessing the text content of messages (required to parse prompts and parameters) now demands the "Message Content Intent" from Discord. This is a privileged intent that requires verification for bots serving over 100 guilds, effectively limiting large-scale SaaS integrations without explicit approval.7  
* **Compliance Risk:** While "archiving" one's own generated content is generally technically feasible and legally defensible under data portability principles, any attempt to scrape public galleries or automate the *generation* process (active automation) carries a high risk of immediate account termination.1

## ---

**A. Discord-Based Retrieval Patterns**

The primary operational theater for Midjourney is the Discord platform. Consequently, any robust retrieval architecture must fundamentally function as a specialized Discord client. The technical challenge lies in distinguishing between the permitted behaviors of a "Bot Application" and the prohibited behaviors of a "User Account" (Self-Bot), while successfully extracting structured data from unstructured chat logs.

### **1\. The Passive Listener Architecture**

The most viable pattern for retrieval is the "Passive Listener." In this model, the retrieval application does not initiate generation requests. Instead, it acts as a silent observer in a Discord channel where a human user (or a distinct, compliant process) interacts with the Midjourney Bot.

#### **Mechanism of Event Interception**

Discord’s Gateway API utilizes a persistent WebSocket connection to push events to connected clients. When the Midjourney Bot completes a generation, it triggers a MESSAGE\_CREATE event (for new grids) or a MESSAGE\_UPDATE event (for progress updates or edits).  
To capture these events programmatically, a developer must register a strict "Bot Application" in the Discord Developer Portal. This bot must be invited to the specific server (Guild) where the Midjourney generation occurs. Crucially, the bot relies on the Gateway Intents system to filter which events it receives.  
**The "Message Content" Hurdle**  
Historically, bots received the full content of all messages in the channels they could access. However, to enhance user privacy, Discord introduced the **Message Content Intent** as a privileged intent.

* **Without Intent:** The bot receives the message object, but the content field (the text of the message) is empty or redacted. It may still see attachments, but losing the content means losing the prompt text, parameters (--ar, \--v), and user attribution data.9  
* **With Intent:** The bot receives the full text. Enabling this requires toggling the "Message Content Intent" in the Developer Portal.4  
* **Verification Threshold:** If the retrieval bot is intended to be distributed to more than 100 servers, Discord mandates a verification process. The developer must justify why the bot needs to read message content. "Archiving user-generated content" is a potentially valid justification, whereas "surveillance" or "analytics" are scrutinized heavily.8

#### **Anatomy of the Midjourney Message Payload**

Understanding the exact structure of the JSON payload sent by Discord is prerequisite to successful retrieval. Midjourney’s message format has evolved, but as of 2026, it generally adheres to a predictable structure that can be parsed via Regular Expressions (Regex) and JSON traversal.  
**The Content Field**  
The content field of the message object typically contains the prompt text and metadata. Midjourney formats this string to highlight the prompt.

* **Format:** \*\*\<PROMPT\_TEXT\>\*\* \--\<PARAMETERS\> \- \<@USER\_ID\> (status)  
* **Parsing Logic:** The retrieval system must employ a regex strategy to extract these components.  
  * *Prompt:* Extracted by capturing text between the initial double asterisks \*\*.  
  * *Parameters:* Extracted by identifying the sequence starting with \-- after the prompt.  
  * *Status:* The trailing text (e.g., (fast), (relaxed)) indicates the generation mode.  
  * *Job ID:* Crucially, the Job ID is **not** present in the content string.

**The Attachments Array**  
The attachments field is a JSON array containing metadata about the files uploaded with the message.

* **Grid Images:** For an initial /imagine command, Midjourney returns a single attachment containing the 2x2 grid. The filename often follows a pattern like grid\_0\_\<UUID\>.webp.  
* **Upscales:** For a specific upscale (U1-U4), the attachment is the single, full-resolution image.  
* **Resolution:** The width and height fields in the attachment object allow the system to verify resolution before downloading.

**The Components Array (Interactive Elements)**  
Modern Discord messages utilize a components field to render interactive buttons (Upscale, Variation, Remix). This field is the most reliable source for the **Job ID** (UUID), which is essential for database deduplication.

* **Custom ID Extraction:** Each button has a custom\_id attribute. For Midjourney, these IDs encode the job's unique identifier.  
  * *Example:* MJ::JOB::upsample::1::550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000  
  * *Extraction Strategy:* A robust parser iterates through the components array, locates a button (Type 2), and regex-matches the UUID from the custom\_id string.10 This is significantly more reliable than parsing filenames, which may be truncated or subject to format changes.

### **2\. Discord Interactions and Slash Commands**

The shift from text-based commands (e.g., \!imagine) to Slash Commands (/imagine) fundamentally changed the visibility of user actions to third-party bots.  
**Visibility Limitations**  
When a user types /imagine in a Discord client, this interaction is an ephemeral communication between the user's client and the Discord API. A third-party "Passive Listener" bot **cannot** see this interaction request. It has no visibility into the command being sent. It only sees the *result* of the interaction—the public message posted by the Midjourney Bot in response.  
**Implications for Retrieval**

* **Latency:** The retrieval system cannot know a job has started until Midjourney acknowledges it with a message (usually the "Waiting to start..." status).  
* **Ephemeral Responses:** If a user utilizes "Stealth Mode" or if an error occurs that generates an "Only visible to you" (ephemeral) response, the third-party bot is completely blind to it. The Discord Gateway simply does not transmit ephemeral messages to other bots in the channel. This means a programmatic retrieval system based on Discord bots is strictly limited to **publicly visible** generations.

### **3\. OAuth2-Based Approaches**

A frequent inquiry in retrieval architecture is whether a developer can utilize Discord's OAuth2 implementation to access a user's message history without adding a bot to a server. The research indicates this path is largely blocked by Discord's permission model.  
**Scope Restrictions** The standard OAuth2 scopes available to web applications (identify, email, guilds) allow for user authentication and reading server membership, but they do **not** grant access to message content.11

* **The messages.read Scope:** There exists a scope named messages.read, but it is restricted. It is primarily designed for local RPC (Rich Presence) server access (e.g., a game running on the user's local machine reading the game invite status). It is **not** permissible for a cloud-based web application to request this scope to read a user's DMs or channel history.12  
* **Data Privacy Barrier:** Discord's architecture is designed to prevent third-party apps from scraping user communications. Granting a third-party app the ability to read all channel history via a simple OAuth login would constitute a massive privacy vulnerability.

**User-Installed Apps (2026 Context)** In late 2024 and 2025, Discord introduced "User-Installed Apps," allowing bots to "travel" with a user across servers. While this increases the *availability* of a bot, it does not bypass the fundamental read-access restrictions. A user-installed bot generally only receives events for messages it interacts with or is mentioned in. It cannot passively scrape a channel it does not have explicit View Channel permissions for, nor can it bypass the "Message Content Intent" requirement.14 Therefore, OAuth2 is not a viable vector for passive retrieval; the bot integration MUST be server-based.

## ---

**B. Non-Discord Approaches**

Given the constraints of the Discord API, developers often investigate direct interaction with Midjourney’s web infrastructure (midjourney.com / alpha.midjourney.com). These methods bypass Discord but introduce significant stability and compliance risks.

### **1\. The Midjourney Web App and "Hidden" APIs**

The Midjourney web application relies on internal API endpoints to populate the user’s gallery. These endpoints are not public, documented, or supported for third-party use, but they exist and are discoverable via network analysis.  
**Endpoint Analysis** Research indicates the existence of endpoints such as https://www.midjourney.com/api/app/recent-jobs or similar variations depending on the API version (V3/V4).15

* **Data Payload:** These endpoints typically return a rich JSON object containing the job\_id, prompt, image\_paths (arrays of image URLs), enqueue\_time, and event\_type (e.g., "upscale", "grid").  
* **Authentication:** Accessing these endpoints requires a valid session cookie. This cookie is obtained through the web app's login flow, which delegates authentication to Discord. A retrieval script would need to automate the Discord OAuth2 login flow, capture the session token, and attach it to subsequent API requests.17

**The Cloudflare Barrier**  
Midjourney employs strict DDoS protection and bot mitigation strategies (likely Cloudflare).

* **TLS Fingerprinting:** Simple HTTP requests (e.g., via Python's requests library) are often rejected because their TLS handshake fingerprint does not match a legitimate browser.  
* **CAPTCHA:** Automated login flows frequently trigger CAPTCHA challenges, which break headless scripts (e.g., Puppeteer, Selenium).18  
* **Maintenance Burden:** The internal API schema changes without notice. A script that works today may break tomorrow when a field name changes from job\_id to id or when the pagination logic is altered.

**Status:** This method is **technically feasible but operationally brittle**. It is classified as "High Maintenance" and "High Risk" due to the likelihood of IP bans or account flagging for "abnormal traffic patterns."

### **2\. The "Download All" Feature and Data Portability**

Midjourney’s web interface includes features for data portability, such as the "Select All" and "Download" options in the archive view.19  
**Programmatic Limitations**  
While useful for manual backups, the "Download All" feature is not exposed as a single API endpoint that zips data on the server side and returns a link. Instead, the web client typically iterates through selected images and triggers individual browser downloads. Replicating this programmatically involves the same hurdles as the internal API scraping described above: authentication, session management, and rate limiting.  
**RSS Feeds** Historical features like personal RSS feeds for user galleries have been inconsistent. In previous versions, users could access an RSS feed of their generations. However, in the modern V6/V7 web interface, reliance on RSS has diminished in favor of the interactive gallery. If an RSS endpoint exists, it often lacks the full metadata (seeds, parameters) available in the JSON API or Discord message object.21

### **3\. Manual "Bring Your Own URL" Flows**

For strict compliance and zero maintenance, a "User-Initiated" flow is the only reliable non-Discord approach.

* **Workflow:** The user generates an image. They copy the link or the Job ID manually. They paste it into the third-party application.  
* **Retrieval:** The application then uses the Job ID to fetch the specific image.  
* **Feasibility:** This relies on the image being publicly accessible via Midjourney’s CDN. With the shift to Signed URLs, even this is complex. The application cannot just take a generic URL; it likely needs to act as a Discord bot to "fetch" the fresh signed URL using the Job ID (if it can link the ID to a message), or the user must upload the binary file directly.

## ---

**C. CDN URL and File Access Realities**

The handling of image assets constitutes the most significant technical shift for Midjourney integrations in the 2025-2026 era. The era of permanent, static image URLs is over.

### **1\. The Migration to Signed URLs**

To combat the abuse of its Content Delivery Network (CDN) for malware hosting, Discord implemented a mandatory URL signing architecture for all attachments.5  
**Technical Specification of Signed URLs**  
A valid Discord CDN URL now contains three mandatory query parameters:

1. ex (Expiration): A hexadecimal timestamp indicating when the link becomes invalid.  
2. is (Issued): A hexadecimal timestamp indicating when the link was generated.  
3. hm (HMAC): A cryptographic signature verifying the integrity of the URL path and timestamps.

**Implication: Link Rot** If a developer extracts a URL like https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/.../image.png?ex=... and saves it to a database, that link will return a 403 Forbidden or 410 Gone error once the ex timestamp is passed (typically 24 hours for links accessed off-platform).6

* *Verification:* Trying to access an old Midjourney link from a year ago without these parameters (or with expired ones) results in an access denial.

### **2\. Caching and Storage Strategies**

This volatility necessitates a fundamental change in retrieval architecture. Applications can no longer be "link aggregators"; they must be "asset managers."  
**The "Download-and-Store" Pattern**  
The only robust solution is to download the image binary **immediately** upon receipt of the MESSAGE\_CREATE event.

* **Process:**  
  1. Bot receives event with Signed URL.  
  2. Bot initiates an HTTP GET request to the Signed URL (validity is guaranteed at the moment of event receipt).23  
  3. Bot receives image binary stream.  
  4. Bot uploads binary to a controlled object storage system (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob, or Cloudflare R2).  
  5. Bot saves the *new* S3 URL to the database.

**The "Refresh" Pattern (Not Recommended)** Technically, it is possible to "refresh" a signed URL by querying the Discord API for the original message again. When the message object is fetched via the API, Discord generates a *new* signed URL with a fresh expiration window.24

* *Why this is Anti-Pattern:* It creates a dependency on the original message existing forever (users might delete it). It also doubles API traffic: every time the app needs to display the image, it might need to re-fetch the URL if the cached one is expired. This is inefficient and latency-inducing compared to owning the asset in S3.

### **3\. Deduplication and Versioning**

Midjourney often regenerates the "same" image reference in different contexts (e.g., in a grid, then in an upscale).

* **Deduplication:** The **Job ID** is the primary key for deduplication. A grid image will have a Job ID. The upscale of index 1 will have a *different* Job ID.  
* **Hashing:** To ensure data integrity, the retrieval system should compute a hash (e.g., SHA-256) of the downloaded binary. This allows detection of exact duplicates even if filenames or URLs differ slightly.

## ---

**D. Rate Limits and Scaling**

Retrieving images at scale requires navigating Discord’s rigorous rate-limiting architecture. A naive implementation that polls for messages will quickly be blocked.

### **1\. The Token Bucket Algorithm**

Discord uses a "Token Bucket" rate-limiting implementation. Every request consumes a token from a specific bucket (associated with a route, like GET /messages).

* **Global Limit:** There is a global hard limit (typically 50 requests per second) for the entire bot application.25  
* **Per-Route Limit:** Specific endpoints have tighter limits. For example, retrieving message history from a specific channel might be limited to 5-10 requests per 5 seconds.  
* **Headers:** Responses contain headers like X-RateLimit-Remaining and X-RateLimit-Reset-After. A robust application must parse these headers and sleep the thread if the remaining count hits 0\.26

### **2\. Polling vs. Event-Driven Design**

**Polling (The Anti-Pattern)**  
A polling architecture works by repeatedly calling GET /channels/{id}/messages every few seconds to check for new items.

* *Inefficiency:* 99% of requests return no new data.  
* *Risk:* It consumes API quota rapidly, increasing the likelihood of hitting rate limits (HTTP 429). Persistent 429 errors can lead to temporary Cloudflare IP bans.26

**Event-Driven (The Standard)**  
The WebSocket Gateway connection allows the bot to receive events *passively*.

* *Efficiency:* The bot maintains one open connection. Discord pushes data only when it exists. This consumes **zero** HTTP API quota for retrieval.  
* *Scalability:* A single bot process can listen to events from thousands of channels simultaneously (via Sharding) without hitting HTTP rate limits.

### **3\. Backfill Strategies**

For retrieving *historical* images (generated before the bot was active), the system must use the HTTP API's pagination features.

* **Pagination:** The GET /messages endpoint supports before, after, and around parameters.27  
* **Backfill Logic:**  
  1. Fetch latest 100 messages.  
  2. Identify the ID of the oldest message in the batch (last\_id).  
  3. Fetch 100 messages before last\_id.  
  4. Repeat until the target date is reached.  
* **Throttling:** This process must be explicitly throttled. A safe implementation might fetch one batch every 1-2 seconds to leave headroom for other operations.

## ---

**E. Security and Compliance**

The viability of any retrieval system hinges not just on code, but on adherence to the complex web of Terms of Service (ToS) governing Discord and Midjourney.

### **1\. Midjourney Terms of Service: Automation vs. Retrieval**

Midjourney’s ToS explicitly forbids "automation".1 However, the community and legal consensus distinguishes between "Active Automation" and "Passive Archival."

* **Active Automation (Prohibited):** Using a script to send /imagine commands. This creates server load and bypasses fair-use limits. This is aggressively policed.  
* **Passive Archival (Grey Area/Permitted):** Using a script to download images *you* (the human) created. This falls under the concept of "Data Portability." Users have a right to access their own data. As long as the retrieval does not stress Midjourney’s servers (which passive Discord listening does not, as it interacts with Discord's servers), it is generally tolerated.  
* **Scraping Others (Prohibited):** Harvesting images from public channels generated by *other* users to build a dataset is a violation of the Community Guidelines and potentially copyright law (depending on jurisdiction and "scraping" definitions).28

### **2\. Discord Developer Policy: Self-Bots vs. App Bots**

* **Self-Bots (Banned):** Automating a standard user account (using a user token) is strictly prohibited by Discord API Terms. It results in immediate account termination.  
* **App Bots (Allowed):** Automating a "Bot Account" created in the Developer Portal is the only sanctioned method.11 The bot must be explicitly invited to the server.

### **3\. Data Retention and Privacy**

* **Consent:** If your app retrieves images from a shared server, it must ensure it only stores images belonging to the authenticated user of your app. Storing other users' data without consent is a privacy violation.  
* **Revocation:** The app must provide a mechanism for users to delete their stored data. If a user disconnects their account, the app should purge their archived images and metadata to comply with GDPR "Right to be Forgotten."

### **4\. Threat Model and Credential Safety**

* **Token Storage:** The Discord Bot Token is equivalent to root access. It must never be committed to version control (Git). It should be injected via Environment Variables (DISCORD\_TOKEN).  
* **Least Privilege:** The bot should strictly request the permissions it needs: View Channels, Read Message History, and Attach Files (if reposting). It does not need Administrator or Manage Server permissions.

## ---

**F. Ranked Architectures**

Based on the analysis of stability, compliance, and maintainability, the following architectures are ranked for implementation.

### **Architecture 1: The "Sidecar" Listener Bot (Recommended)**

**Type:** Discord Gateway Bot (Passive)  
**Complexity:** Medium | **Maintenance:** Low | **Reliability:** High

* **Summary:** A dedicated Discord Bot is added to a private server used by the user for generation. The user generates images manually. The bot listens to the Gateway, detects the user's images, downloads them to S3, and catalogs metadata in a database.  
* **Capabilities:** Retrieves final images, upscales, prompt text, parameters, and timestamps. Can extract Job IDs via button components.  
* **Why Top Ranked:** It uses official, stable Discord APIs. It respects the "Passive" nature required for compliance. It solves the CDN expiry issue by owning the storage.

### **Architecture 2: The User-Installed App Integration**

**Type:** Discord App (User Scope)  
**Complexity:** High | **Maintenance:** Medium | **Reliability:** Medium

* **Summary:** Leveraging the "User-Installed App" feature (2025/2026), the bot is installed to the user's account rather than a specific server.  
* **Flow:** The bot attempts to listen to events across servers where the user operates.  
* **Critical Flaw:** Due to privacy restrictions, the bot often cannot read message content in servers it hasn't been explicitly invited to, rendering it ineffective in public Midjourney servers. It works best if the user still invites it to their private context.  
* **Why Second:** Higher complexity in setup and permission handling with fewer guarantees of data visibility compared to the server-based bot.

### **Architecture 3: The Headless Browser Scraper**

**Type:** Web Automation (Puppeteer/Playwright)  
**Complexity:** Very High | **Maintenance:** Nightmare | **Reliability:** Low

* **Summary:** A script launches a headless Chrome instance, logs into midjourney.com as the user, and scrapes the gallery page or internal API.  
* **Capabilities:** Can trigger "Download All" features. Access to collections.  
* **Why Last:** It fights a constant war against Cloudflare, CAPTCHAs, and DOM changes. It risks flagging the user's account for suspicious login activity. It is not "programmatic" in a reliable sense.

### **Trade-off Matrix**

| Feature | Arch 1: Sidecar Bot | Arch 2: User App | Arch 3: Web Scraper |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Reliability** | **High** (Official API) | Medium (Permission variance) | **Low** (Anti-bot defenses) |
| **ToS Compliance** | **High** (Official Bot) | High | **Low** (Scraping/User Autom.) |
| **Ban Risk** | Low | Low | **High** |
| **Implementation Cost** | Medium (Hosting/S3) | Medium | High (Proxy rotation) |
| **Speed** | Real-time (Gateway) | Real-time | Batch/Delayed |
| **Maintenance Burden** | Low (Stable API) | Medium | **High** (DOM changes) |
| **Data Ownership** | Full (S3) | Full (S3) | Local Files |
| **Backfill Capability** | **Excellent** (API Pagination) | Limited | Good (Gallery Scroll) |

## ---

**G. Recommended Path: Implementation Guide**

### **Phase 1: MVP (Proof of Concept)**

**Objective:** Verify capability to capture a prompt and image URL from a live Midjourney session.

1. **Developer Portal:** Create a new Application in the Discord Developer Portal.  
2. **Bot Creation:** Add a Bot user. **Enable "Message Content Intent"** in the "Privileged Gateway Intents" section. This is the most critical step.4  
3. **Invite:** Generate an OAuth2 URL with scopes: bot. Permissions: Read Messages/View Channels, Read Message History.  
4. **Server Setup:** Create a private testing server. Invite the Midjourney Bot and your new Bot.  
5. **Code (Python/discord.py):**  
   * Initialize discord.Client with intents.message\_content \= True.  
   * In on\_ready(): Print "Connected".  
   * In on\_message(message):  
     * Check if message.author.id \== MIDJOURNEY\_BOT\_ID.  
     * Print message.content (Verify prompt text is visible).  
     * Print message.attachments (Verify Signed URL presence).  
     * Print message.components (Verify Button IDs for Job ID extraction).

### **Phase 2: Production Hardening (The "Simple App")**

**Objective:** A persistent service that archives images to S3 and metadata to a database.

1. **Storage Infrastructure:** Set up an AWS S3 bucket. Configure permissions for write access.  
2. **Database:** Deploy a lightweight SQL database (PostgreSQL or SQLite for small scale).  
   * *Schema:* Table Jobs { uuid, prompt, params, s3\_path, discord\_msg\_id, created\_at, status }.  
3. **The Retrieval Logic (Pseudo-Code):**

Python

\# Event Listener  
async def on\_message(message):  
    if message.author.id\!= MIDJOURNEY\_BOT\_ID: return

    \# 1\. Parse Data  
    job\_uuid \= extract\_uuid\_from\_components(message.components)  
    prompt, params \= regex\_parse\_content(message.content)  
      
    \# 2\. Handle Image  
    if message.attachments:  
        signed\_url \= message.attachments.url  
          
        \# 3\. Immediate Download (Critical for CDN Expiry)  
        image\_data \= http\_get(signed\_url).content  
          
        \# 4\. Upload to Owned Storage  
        s3\_key \= f"archive/{job\_uuid}.webp"  
        s3\_client.upload(image\_data, s3\_key)  
          
        \# 5\. Persist Metadata  
        db.save(uuid=job\_uuid, prompt=prompt, s3\_url=s3\_key)

4. **Backfill Script:** Create a separate script that runs once. It calls channel.history(limit=None). It iterates backward, performing the same parsing and downloading logic for every historical message found.

### **Red Flags & Anti-Patterns**

* **Self-Bots:** Never use your personal user token to run the script. Discord detects this via "User-Agent" and traffic patterns, leading to bans.14  
* **Hotlinking:** Never store the cdn.discordapp.com URL directly in your app's database. It *will* break in 24 hours due to signature expiration.5  
* **Public Scraping:** Do not point your bot at the public \#newbies channels in the official Midjourney server. Processing that volume of firehose data will likely trigger rate limits or abuse detection verification, and capturing other users' data violates privacy expectations. Keep the bot in a controlled, private or semi-private server.

This report confirms that while no official door exists, a reliable side-entrance can be constructed using standard Discord architecture, provided the developer rigorously adheres to the "Passive Listener" pattern and manages their own asset storage.
